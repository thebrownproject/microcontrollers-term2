    "#### Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor\n",
    "A PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor is a low‑power motion detector that “listens” for changes in the infrared energy emitted by warm objects in its field of view. Behind its Fresnel‑lens cover sits a pyroelectric element that generates tiny charges when its temperature changes; as a person or animal moves between the lens’s segmented zones, the IR level spikes and drops. These pulses are amplified and converted into a simple digital output—HIGH when motion is detected, LOW otherwise—making PIR modules ideal for security alarms, automatic lighting, and occupancy sensing.\n",
